This patch removes the underwater effects for better visibility at the price of immersion (Gothic, Gothic Sequel, Gothic 2, and Gothic 2 NotR). 

Visual effects (blue screen blend, distortion, decreased visibility) and acoustic effects (dampening of sounds) are disabled. The patch is useful to make search and fetch quests easier under water.

This is a modular modification (a.k.a. patch or add-on) that can be installed and uninstalled at any time and is virtually compatible with any modification.
It supports <kbd>Gothic 1</kbd>, <kbd>Gothic Sequel</kbd>, <kbd>Gothic II (Classic)</kbd> and <kbd>Gothic II: NotR</kbd>.
